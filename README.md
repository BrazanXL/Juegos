Hey Hello...<br>
I am BrazanXL and this is my first repository ...<br>
Always read the "<b><i>Notas.md</i></b>" file to be aware of new updates.<br>
</p>
<p>
I am adapting to "<b><i>GitHub.com</i></b>" and the notes will be here in the project temporarily, therefore the "<b><i>Notas.md</i></b>" file will be constantly updated and when I finally get familiar with the workspace it will stop updating.
